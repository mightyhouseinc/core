# This test verifies that Python Loader loads local scripts before global ones
# test.py has the same file name (without extension) as the test module from Python stdlib
# so basically what happens is that Python is seeing an "import test", and loads first the
# stdlib module instead of the test.py, with the refactor done, the local file should be load first
